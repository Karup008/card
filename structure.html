    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is used in a variety of databases, and it is commonly applied in back end development. The language is mainly used to manage and update records, and access and change databases. Since nearly every website makes use of back end data storage, SQL provides a solid foundation in database-oriented literacy needed in full stack development — especially regarding software built to house sensitive data.

        Rust
        
        Rust is also a highly regarded programming language used in web development, ranking as Stack Overflow’s “most loved” language per its 2020 survey. Rust is commonly used to improve a web page’s speed, parallelism, and inherent memory safety, and it too is valued for its wide range of uses. These include game engine design, operating system construction, and browser component implementation.
        
        Java
        
        Java tends to rank highly among many top programming language rankings and surveys. This general-purpose language is primarily used in back end web development, and can be applied to a wide variety of different software types. It is imperative for full stack developers to learn languages like Java, as they can be applied to countless scenarios in application construction, maintenance, and conceptualization.
